In the updated version of the game, I improved code structure and added multiplayer functionality. The major changes include:

- Multiplayer Support: Implemented a system where two players take turns, tracking their scores separately. Added a player turn display and scoreboard that updates dynamically.
- Player Turn Logic: The game now correctly switches turns only when a player does not find a match, keeping the same player's turn when they match cards.
- Improved UI Elements: Added new UI elements (h2 for player turn and p for scores) dynamically within the game container.
- Cleaner Conditionals: Reformatted announceWinner() using a more concise ternary operator to determine the winner.
- Reorganized Function Order: Grouped related functions together (e.g., game setup, card interactions, and UI updates) for better readability.
- Consistent Naming and Formatting: Standardized comment styles, improved spacing, and optimized conditional checks for better maintainability.
